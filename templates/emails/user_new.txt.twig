Welcome to Core {{ patients_name }}!

I created Core to allow friends to compete and play on their fitness journey now matter
what hardware they use; Fitbit, Samsung Health and soon Google Fit.

Core is currently in the Private Alpha stage. This means that things are changing and
updating at a lightning pace, but it also means something might break or change. So I
just want to take the opportunity to thank you for taking part and helping me make Core
something to be proud of.

During this stage you may get the occasional email asking you to test a new feature. This
is, of course, fully optional but I really do appreciate any feedback you can provide.

If you want to talk to me, or other Core users, join our
reddit community (https://www.reddit.com/r/NxFIFTEEN_Core/) and get where I'll
do my best to resolve any problems you might have - or add any features you would like to see.
